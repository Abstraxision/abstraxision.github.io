Introduction

Hi everyone, 

# I'm **Abstrax **
> I study Mathematical Statistics and am transitioning from a PhD to a Masters.
> I spend most of my time as a TA or exploring resources related to my field of study. 

__Current topics I've been interested in and some random facts are below:__

> ||* My studies were mostly theoretical and I used `RStudio` for `LaTex`/`R`/`Md`, but I've very recently discovered resources such as `GitHub`, `VSCode` and `CSS` scripts for grading. 
> ||
> ||* If you ever want to compare notes or study together, I'd love to since most of my *coding* knowledge is from consuming open-source material while aimlessly pressing render/compile. 
> ||
> ||* Recently, I've been interested in integrative programming related to statistics, exploring more accessible sources and spending inordinate amounts of time on formatting trivialities. I torturously switched from `RStudio` to `VScode` with `Quarto` and have been fervently reading random things related to inclusive environments and how people utilize `GitHub`. ||
