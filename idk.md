# Plague’s Posture Protocol
* Generally, **compound** (*involving multiple muscles*) posterior chain exercises such as the deadlift are good for posture.
  - This depends on which posture issues you have:
    - **Anterior pelvic tilt** is where your stomach sticks out in the front and your booty sticks out the back, making a lower back arch.
      - If that's the case, you need to improve **glute strength** (*squats, glute bridges etc*) as well as **abdominal muscle strength** (*through isometric exercises like planks or hollow body holds, not static like sit ups and leg raises which only worsen hip flexor mobility, making the issue worse*)
* Last step is working on **mobility** (hip flexors)
* If your shoulders are rounded, it's most likely an internal rotation issue that will be helped by strengthening muscles of the rotator cuff by doing exercises like face pulls.
* Stretching always helps with posture too. There are two stretches I do everyday without exception: 
  - First one is a deep squat and then lifting my hand towards the ceiling. 
    - First supinated, then switch and finally pronate the hand. This helps with hip, ankle and back mobility and feels real nice.      
  - The other exercise is Wall angels, you can google the form for this one.
* For neck posture, you're mostly better off doing light work and stretching — it's mostly about lifestyle habits like holding your phone too low or your monitor and chair not being adjusted properly.
